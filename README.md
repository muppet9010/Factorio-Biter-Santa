# Factorio-Biter-Santa
Adds a biter santa that can be called in by command, will land and then can be dismissed by command to fly away.


Features
-------

A flying Santa sleigh being pulled by biters. Made from ingame assets so fits in base game graphically.

Santa will take 60 tiles to land and take off using a horizontal (runway) approach. It will detroy any ground based things in this path.

Options for Santa to use Vertical Take Off or a runway take off to depart.

Configurable start, landing and disappearing position through the clouds.

Configurable santa status messages.


Commands
-------

call-santa: Call santa to fly in and land

dismiss-santa: Send santa to take off and fly away

delete-santa: Removes santa from the map instantly


Notes
-----

Some of the graphics and effects are a bit rough, this is my first exploration in this.

Best used during the day as no lights are included on santa. This is as I can't make lights on santa affect only it and not the buildings behind it due to Factorios 2D view of height.

All mod settings are cached for santa when called in to avoid weird situations. So set everything up first.
