- make an entity for biter santa
- a way to set his spawn, movement speed, landing and stop locations
- make a VTOL image for him and an end position to move to before disappearing

- Make seperate entity/graphics for the biters to be able to run whne moving and for the spitter to be able to turn and shoot.
- Change spitter to be HD graphics version from Derp. Also check the mask as it incorrectly bulks up the spitter in old way I did it.
