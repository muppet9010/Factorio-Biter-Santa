- make sparks on wheels landing
- make tiny smoke puffs under the pulling biters when air borne
- make a VTOL image for him and an end position to move to before disappearing


- seperate out shadows so that when flying they are on the ground in the correct place, based on height
- Make seperate entity/graphics for the biters to be able to run whne moving and for the spitter to be able to turn and shoot.
- Change spitter to be HD graphics version from Derp. Also check the mask as it incorrectly bulks up the spitter in old way I did it.
- make big smoke for the entry and exiting of santa
